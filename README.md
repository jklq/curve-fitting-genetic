# curve-fitting-genetic

A genetic algorithm for fitting a curve

Doing this from scratch off of the wikipedia pages abot [Genetic Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_programming) and [Trees](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)>).

I purposly did not look at any programming examples.
